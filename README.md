## Project Overview

This project is a responsive web page built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**. It is designed to demonstrate the ability to translate a wireframe into an interactive, responsive design. The page includes a navigation bar, a hero section, and a grid of cards that adjust based on the screen size.

## Features

1. **Responsive Navigation Bar**: 
   - A navigation bar that adapts to different screen sizes.
  
2. **Hero Section**: 
   - A section with a background image and text overlay.
   
3. **Responsive Grid**: 
   - A grid of four cards, each containing an image, title, and description. 
   - The grid layout adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries.
   
4. **Mobile-First Design**:
   - The design is optimized for smaller screens and scales up for larger screens.

5. **Basic Interactivity**:
   - A simple modal or smooth scroll effect (if implemented).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structuring the web page.
- **CSS3**: Styling the page using Flexbox and Grid for responsive layout.

## Getting Started

To view the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd project-directory
   ```
3. **Open `index.html`** in your browser to view the webpage:
   - You can either open the file directly or use a simple HTTP server (like `live-server` or any other web server).

### Project Structure

```
.
├── index.html       # Main HTML file
├── style.css        # Main CSS file
├── script.js        # JavaScript for interactivity (if applicable)
    
```

## Challenges & Approach

- **Responsive Design**: Media queries and flexible layouts (Flexbox and Grid) were used to ensure the page adapts smoothly across different devices.
  
- **Hero Section Overlay**: Positioned text over the hero image using absolute positioning and ensured it stays centered across all screen sizes.

- **Mobile-First**: The design was developed with mobile users in mind first, then expanded for larger devices using media queries.
